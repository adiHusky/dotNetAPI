# dotNetAPI
This is the backend app which fetches the lyrics of the song as per the path

# Instructions for running app after cloning
- dotnet run
- Open link https://localhost:5001/Music/ and if everything goes well you will see a page My Jukebox which is HTML DIV content
- Similarly there are different paths like /Music/NotAfraid and others
- Our next step will be to use two different apps, one will be React Frontend app and other will be DotNet MVC app which will fetch data from this API app
